# Landing On Arch Linux

### Windows XP

Around 2009 was when I got access to my first ever computer. My family bought a second hand used computer from somewhere I don't remember. I remember my uncle getting a CD from someone he knew that had the infamous `INSERT_WINDOWS_XP_KEY` written on top the CD. He used that code to install a fresh version of windows XP and we used that for years. I loved that machine, I could spent hours on it without ever feeling any tiredness.

However at this time, I was also not aware of any other types of operating system (OS). It was just Windows and that's it. I knew there were different versions of windows, my friend also had a computer that had Windows 7 on it and it looked really modern at the time. But I still loved the look and feel of my own machine with Windows XP on it.

I also don't remember ever wanting to customise any part of my OS experience. Partly maybe because I was interested more in using that machine for just surfing the internet and playing games and nothing else. But I remember my friend having cool widgets on his home screen on Windows 7 and a cool looking calendar. Again, to me it just looked like clutter and I didn't care for it whatsoever.

### Windows 8 & Windows 10

2013 I got my first ever laptop, a HP laptop with intel i5 and 8GB RAM. My grandma got that for me and my brother as a gift, I still have that with me in my cupboard (although ofcourse it's not very functional anymore).

The laptop came with Windows 8 installed on it already and I remember how happy I was having my very own laptop that I can take anywhere, use anywhere, without any curfew (for the most part).

But once again, I really did not care about wanting a more custom experience exactly to my needs. The defaults it came with, I was happy with. I used this machine for once again games and school work. Google Chrome, Microsoft Suite, League of Legends and Minecraft were the most run applications on that computer by far.

A couple of years of using Windows 8 and whenver Windows 10 came out I immediately installed it without any hesitation.

That was the one thing about me. I didn't care about wanting to customise my OS but I did care about always using the latest version of Windows at that point. Contrary to enjoying Windows XP over Windows 7 when I was young, I always wanted to have the latest OS installed on my machine.

A Windows release is always hit or miss. Sometimes the world loves a new release of Windows and sometimes they absolutely despise it and don't upgrade for years. That wasn't and isn't the case with me. A new version of Windows is released? Nice! I'm exciting to install it.

At this time of course I also became aware of the Apple garden and macOS. But I had never actually experienced it myself. From what I had heard and seen on the internet, I knew I wouldn't enjoy macOS. I know this is coming from someone who doesn't really care about customising their OS like that at this point, but still just knowing you're not really allowed to change much even if you want to, felt very claustrophobic.

I used Windows for years and I still have Windows 11 on a separate drive. I don't hate it like some hardcore Linux users and I never will. Windows is and will be the default for most people in the world for a long long time and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

It comes with a solid default package with room for plenty of customisation needed for the regular computer user.

### A Taste of Linux

13 years after first encountering and using Windows, in 2021 I come across Linux when I got into programming. The bootcamp I was on gave us all a remote AWS Linux machine. Even though I was still controlling it from a Windows machine, and it was just a window on my screen; I was enjoying using it for programming.

I loved using the terminal, it made me feel cool. It made me feel like I am communicating with the Computer in its language instead of the computer making it easy for me carry out tasks in a graphical user interface (GUI). I loved that when you log into Linux you don't use your mouse to open the browser or whichever application you want. You log in by inputting your passcode in your keybaord and then you keep your hand on your keyboard to open whichever application you want or open the terminal.

I can't put it into words but using Linux makes you feel like YOU are the one in control and not being controlled. You only understand this feeling once you start using Linux. Now some people who aren't interested in computers like that won't enjoy this because that's not what they want from a computer. And that's completely fine!

I used that remote Linux machine for 3 months until my bootcamp finished. After that I had to come back to my windows and start doing coding with a windows machine. And surprise surprise, the Windows experience just does not compare, it can't compete with Linux when it comes to development.

Even though I installed git bash terminal and also installed WSL to develop. it just DOES. NOT. COMPARE. On Linux it just feels better to code in all aspects.

### Ubuntu, Here We Go

2022, I buy a separate SSD and install Ubuntu (linux mint) onto it, and thus my Linux journey begins.

Installing and using Ubuntu was a fun experience. Once again, like all the operating systems I have used so far I didn't really customise much. Just slapped on a wallpaper I liked and started using Ubuntu. I did this for months and was happy.

I felt like just by solving occasional issues I faced with my distro I was becoming a better programmer, and programming was the sole reason that made me switch to Linux in the first place.

I learned mounting and dismounting hard drives. I learned grep. I learned to create bash scripts to fix suspend issues I was having on my machine. I learned how packages and applications are managed in various distros and why snap is so annoying. I learned to do SO MUCH STUFF through the terminal and it felt awesome always leveling up.

So I'm using Ubuntu, I'm happy, I'm enjoying Linux but then... why Arch?

### Switching to Arch Linux

14 years of using a computer and there have always been only two ways I have switched between applications. Either by clicking on the application with my mouse, or using `CTRL` + `TAB` until I land on the application I want. After doing an action for a long period of time, it kind of becomes your default. You cannot really fathom doing that any other way. But every Linux video I would watch, I'd see the person moving applications so fast. And I told myself it's time I also join them.

So I went to search for what tiling window manager would best suit me.
- Tried `i3wm` but it felt hard to use and felt like you get very bearbones stuff. Uninstaled.
- Tried `awesomewm`, really liked it. Espacially with my dual monitor setup, it works wonders.
- Then I saw `Hyprland`. It looked so, SO cool the visuals and the way your tabs move. I really wanted to try it but on my distro it didn't install properly.

I could've stuck with awesomewm because I really enjoyed my experience but part of me really wanted to give `Hyprland` a go. And so I started getting thoughts of switching my distro and trying something esle.

After watching a plathera of videos, I kept hearing more and more about `Arch` and how it gives you full control. Also, I had a co-worker who also used linux for his machine and he ran arch as well. And he's a pretty smart dev, a really good mentor to lookup to.

And I told myself, well if I'm gonna try a new distro why not try arch. The other options I didn't really feel any sort of connection to.

### Installing and Staying with Arch

Installing arch was such a cool experience. It gave me the same feeling as when I first started doing things inside a terminal. Once again I felt like I'm leveling myself up and becoming better. Paritioning my SSD, selecting the packages I need, my login manager; it all felt so bearbones and cool.

I have been using `Arch` for some time now and I don't see myself going back. The setup I have now feels like the exactly the setup i need. It's very minimal, nothing fancy.

Oh and I tried `Hyprland` but I didn't really like it at the end and switched back to `awesomewm` and have a solid config that suits my needs :)
